							<p>One of the biggest problems in our world is food and pollution. We’re
								making a website that helps these two problems. Our drones are
								solar-powered and they won’t create pollution and they’re very safe for
								people and the world. This helps pollution which helps global- warming.
								The food is being dropped off to help those who don’t live near food
								stores or near a farm so they don’t have to travel a lot and create
								pollution. The more we create pollution the more we’re adding damage to
								the world. </p>
							<p/> We can use drones to fly the food out to areas that don’t have an immediate food store near it. You can use our website to deliver food and drop it off. We can also use solar-powered drones and they can have sensors to see when it gets too close to people or houses. Once it sees it got to close to these items it will be brought up 25 ft to get away from the risk of hurting people. The drones are waterproof and aerodynamic. While you order your food you’ll get notified when the food is being delivered and when your food is at your house. After the drone drops the food off, the drone will leave and you can have a great meal and you’ll always be able to order and know that we’re a trusted so We’ll have a GPS system that uses coding to navigate around the terrain. The GPS also will send you a verification code to make sure we have the right address and make sure we deliver it to the right house and the urce. right person. If we ever mess up your order or delivery you will get a 50% coupon to make it up to you. The impact it will have is that it will change the way people look at shipping with cars or trucks it will be delivered using something that doesn’t produce pollution and it’s going to be faster. It won’t have to wait in traffic and it’s going to have same-day delivery. People won’t have to worry about driving 5 miles to go get the food. They can have it delivered to their house or their local store.</p>
